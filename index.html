        <h1>About Nora</h1>
        <p>Nora received a B.S. in Cellular and Molecular Biology and a B.A. in Music Performance from the George Washington University, and joined the Goard Lab in 2020 as a graduate student in the Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology PhD program.</p>
        <p>While in D.C., she worked at the National Institutes of Health studying the neural circuitry underlying feeding behavior. She is excited to continue investigating circuit-level dynamics in the context of memory and spatial coding.</p>
        <p>While not in lab, Nora enjoys long walks on the beach and trying to find ways to use her music degree.</p>
